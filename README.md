   ### Add CometChatPro SDK in project
   
   ### CocoaPods:
   
   We recommend using CocoaPods, as they are the most advanced way of managing iOS project dependencies. Open a terminal   window, move to your project directory, and then update the SDK  by running the following command.
   
   ```
   $ pod install
   ```
   
   If the pod installation fails due to Cocoapods dependancy issue then use the below command to install the framework through cocoapods.
  
  ```
   pod install --repo-update
   ```
